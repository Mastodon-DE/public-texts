**Addendum 1:** The company currently behind mastodon.de

These costs have so far been paid out of the pocket of Erik Uden's open source software company called [Uden AI](https://uden.ai), which is also currently the legal vehicle for MastodonDE. @ErikUden founded Uden UG (*haftungsbeschränkt*) in February 2021 and is the CEO and sole employee of the company. It provides web services (*web hosting, web design, etc.*) and only creates open source code. I, Erik Uden, am writing this text just to make it clear that no exploitation had to take place in order to finance MastodonDE. I worked completely alone and earned the money needed to cover the monthly costs of MastodonDE a few times through a few invoices - all of that whilst getting my high school diploma, doing political work, and later also alongside my studies at university.


**Addendum 2:** Electricity cost calculations
  
Since we have solar panels, we only pay 0.10 € / KWh on a sunny day, but since our batteries only store 6 KWh (*which are often not enough overnight*) and at the same time the servers are not the only devices in the household that consume electricity, a large part of the energy used by the rack still costs ~0.195€ / KWh.
  
~~So we are currently counting on the worst-case scenario, knowing that it will not be the case for most of the summer months. Since the servers are currently running for less than two weeks, it is difficult to estimate not only how high the actual power consumption is, but also how high the proportion of solar energy used is. Using records from the previous year, we can roughly calculate how many kilowatt hours had to be drawn from the grid at the end of the month and how many were fed in, so we can predict how much electricity we will have to get from the grid given our new increased electricity consumption, but this Numbers are very speculative, which is why we stick to 0.195 € / KWh values with the 1.0 KW to be on the safe side.~~

~~We will of course adjust this article and the numbers mentioned in it as soon as we have newer data and facts after the servers have been in operation for a longer period of time and regularly. These are our current, best and conservative estimates of the cover costs in optimal operation.~~

We no longer expect the worst-case scenario and have been able to create a better forecast for the future by evaluating the data from the last few months! :BlinkingCursor:
