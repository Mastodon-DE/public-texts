**Addendum 1:** The company currently behind mastodon.de

These costs are so far covered out Erik Uden's open source software company called [Uden AI](https://uden.ai) which is also for the moment the legal vehicle behind MastodonDE. Erik Uden founded Uden UG (*haftungsbeschränkt*) (*comparable to an LLC/Ltd*) in February 2021 and is the CEO as well as the sole employee of the company. It mainly provides web services (*web-hosting, web-design, etc.*) and generates exclusively open source code. I, Erik Uden, am writing this text just to make clear that no exploitation had to happen to fund MastodonDE. I worked completely on my own and earned the necessary money to cover the monthly costs of MastodonDE for a few times through a few invoices over the past years. I did all of that next to getting my high school diploma, next to my political work, and later also next to studying in university.  



**Addendum 2:** Calculation of the electricity cost  

Since we have photovoltaic panels, on a sunny day we pay only 0.10 € / KWh, but since our batteries store only 6 KWh (which often do not last overnight) and at the same time the servers are not the only devices in the household that consume electricity, a large part of the energy consumed by the rack still costs ~0.40€ / KWh.  

So we are currently calculating with the worst-case scenario knowing that it won't be like that for most of the summer months. However, since the servers are currently running for less than two weeks, it is difficult to estimate not only how much electricity is actually consumed, but also how much solar energy is used. Based on last year's records we can calculate approximately how many kilowatt hours had to be drawn from the grid at the end of the month, and how many were injected, so we can predict how much electricity we will have to draw from the grid with our new increased power consumption, but these figures are very speculative, which is why we stay with the 1.1 KW at 0.40 € / KWh values to be on the safe side.  

We will adjust this post and the numbers mentioned in it as soon as we have newer data and facts after a longer and regular operation of the servers, of course. These are our current, best and conservative estimates of the covering costs in optimal operation. :BlinkingCursor:
