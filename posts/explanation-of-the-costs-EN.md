How does this all add up...? :blobcatfearful:
</br>
</br>
*Electricity costs* :blobcat_rss:
We pay 0.40 € / KWh, the rack for #MastodonDE consumes ~1 KW, however at peak times also ~1.3 KW, so we calculate with 1.1 KW.

So 1.1 KW × 0.40 € / KWh × 24h × 30 days = **316.8 € / month**.

*Internet* :ablobfoxloading:
The servers are operated out of the home of @ErikUden and also use his Internet bandwidth for more than 50%, however, in order to simplify calculations we will pretend as if the servers use 50% and the other 50% continues to be used privately. Since MastodonDE is also reachable by phone via this telephone line + internet contract, it is also fair to charge 50% for it.  
  
We have the *Red Internet & Phone 1000 Cable* from Vodafone with **1150 Mbit/s download and 56.7 Mbit/s upload, this costs 70 € / month**.  
  
70 € / 2 = 35 €.  
  
MastodonDE thus needs to pay 35 € / month for the Internet connection.  
  
  
</br>
  
*Web-Server* :blobcatcode:
We use a Hetzner cloud server for the join-mastodon.de website, so that site is independent from our infrastructure.
This web-server costs 0.0392 € / hour (*0.0008 € for the IPv4, 0.0384 € for the server*), with 730.485 hours in a month, this results in **28.64€ / month.**

***Total 396.36 € / month*** :blobcatgoogly:
  
With this money we could maintain MastodonDE if:  
No device or server ever breaks and needs to be replaced :blobcateyes:
Storing backups externally wouldn't cost money :blobfoxlaughsweat:  
We never need external help :blobfoxnomcat:  
We never get in legal trouble :blobcatfearful:
No one will ever be compensated for working on the project, or paid for previous expenses :blobcatmeowcouple:  
  
  
As you can easily see by reading this post the 396.36 € are really **only to cover the costs at optimal operation**. If this value is reached by donations there are no more running costs on our end, which we, beside our time, gladly sacrifice for this project, but possibly cannot continue to do forever.
  
  
In the long run MastodonDE shall become a non-profit **to ensure that we as a platform always remain advertising-free, algorithm-free, without data theft, anti-commercial as well as anti-capitalist!**  
  
To make this possible we need donations of *at least* 396.36 € / month.

**Once this bill is covered, MastodonDE will be possible to continue existing long-term!** :erikuden:
