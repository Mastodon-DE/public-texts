And here is an exact [chronological list of all expenses and donations](https://mastodon.de/@MastodonDE/111737398475692330).
  
  
How does it all fit together?
 
</br>

# Electricity cost
We pay ~0.19 € / KWh, the rack for #MastodonDE consumes ~0.9 KW, but also ~1.2 KW at peak operation, so we calculate with a usage of 1.0 KW.

So 1.0 KW × 0.1941 € / KWh × 24h × 30 days = **139.73 € / month**.
  
</br>

# Cloud servers

## Root server
For the mastodon.de instance we use a Hetzner root server (`AX52 | Upgrade to DDR5 ECC RAM | Primary IPv4`) which costs 80.92 € / month.


## Web server
For the website join-mastodon.de we use a separate Hetzner cloud server ('CPX11 | x86 | 40 GB | eu-central'), so that the site is independent from the rest of our infrastructure.
This web server costs 5.20 € / month.

In total we pay **86.19 € / month** for the servers.
  
</br>

# Internet
Some of the servers are operated in @ErikUden's private home and therefore also use his internet connection. Since the company behind it, Uden UG (*limited liability*), can also be reached by telephone via this combined contract, this is included in the price.
  
We have the *Red Internet & Phone 1000 Cable* from Vodafone with **1150 Mb/s download and 56.7 Mbit/s upload, this costs 70 € / month**.
  
70 € / 2 = 35 €.
  
So MastodonDE pays **35 € / month for an internet connection**.

***A total of 276.84 € / month***
  
With this money we could run MastodonDE if:
- No device or server ever breaks and needs to be replaced
- Storing the backups externally would not cost any money
- We never need external help
- We never get into legal problems
- No one is paid for work on the project or previous expenses are paid
  
  
As you can easily see when reading this article, the **276.84 € is really only to cover the costs of optimal operation**. When this value is reached, there are no more costs that we are left with, which, in addition to our time, we would like to spend on this project, but may not be able to spend forever.
  
  
In the long term, MastodonDE will become its own e.V. **to ensure that as a platform we will always remain ad-free, algorithm-free, data theft, anti-commercial and anti-capitalist!**
  
To make this possible we need donations of 276.84 € / month.

**Once this bill is covered, MastodonDE will run long-term!** :erikuden: :MastodonDE:
